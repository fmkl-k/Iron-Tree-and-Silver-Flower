# Iron Tree Silver Flower【a project biased on Arduino and Unity】<br /> 
## Project Introduction: <br /> 
This project is an interactive game installation based on Arduino and Unity.<br /> 
## Operating Instructions: <br /> 
To run the project, open the Arduino program files in the Arduino IDE for testing and execution. Additionally, objects in Unity need to be assigned corresponding scripts. Furthermore, an external printing device needs to be connected.<br /> 

## Brief Description: <br /> 
Ensure that the Arduino board is connected to two TTP223 touch sensors, an HC-SR04 distance sensor, and an MPU6050 gyroscope. In Unity, ensure that the Uduino plugin and LCPrinter plugin are installed. <br />
